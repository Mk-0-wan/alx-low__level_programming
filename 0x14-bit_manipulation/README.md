## Bit Twiddling
Welcome to another yet great dir where we are going to play around with the most useful power of bit and binary itself.
Will be tackling some small and advanced end concepts over here.

## Keep on the Radar ðŸ¤–
`~` - change the bit state.
`|` - perform a bit or operation.
`&` - check if a bit is set or not.
`<<` - shift bit to the left.
`>>` - shift bit to the right.
`^` - exclusive or (if both match then change bit state).

With this in mind we are able to perform a bunch of more cool bit manipulation tricks and solutions.<br>
Down below i have listed all the possible and most ways bit manipulation are used.
