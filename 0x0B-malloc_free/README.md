## Dynamic Memory allocation
Imagine having the power of always making all the string of chars to fit in a given memory block and it's not fixed but flexible.
Able to change its size from small of big to whatever is passed to it for storage purpose.
Its like you will never lack memory for a given string and start worries if it will fit or not.
Again all this is done in the heap memory.
