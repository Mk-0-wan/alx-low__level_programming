### RECURSION
***

You will need to understand the exit value.
A program that keeps on calling itself in order to get the smallest value possible.
Finding the smallest value solves the rest of the code frames found in the stack.
All memory is saved in the stack memory. Which will later on be released when the smallest value is found.
