## STRUCTURES
C structures is just a cool way where one can create their own data type filled with a mixture of all other defined data-types.

With this power we can have the power to almost create objects sharing the same traits.

### Tips and Tricks
* Use of typedef to make ease of using a struct in your code
* Any data to be collected from the user and proccessed learn to make use of malloc and free

Malloc allows you to make use of memory blocks in the heap which will be easy to store data or even sometimes functions.

Which can be called later on to make use of them. Make it a habbit to always check if both the struct was successfully initalized and
all the allocated blocks were successfuly allocated.
