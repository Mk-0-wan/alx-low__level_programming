## More Singly Linked Lists
Hello world today i will be doing a task including more singly linked list practices.<br>
Will be a more deep dive into the true power of linked list and how it really works.<br>
Super excited to do this task today hope you will enjoy the reading through it.

## How it really works
`**head` - passing a pointer which points to another pointer most probaly as the name sugges the head node(which is a head pointer).<br>
`[dptr] -> [rptr] -> {memory address} && (containing some values.)`<br>
If i really want to access the head   `rptr` values i will have to first pass in the `[dptr]`<br>
Then when we get the `rptr` we can be able to play around with its values and make all the changes you want.<br>
